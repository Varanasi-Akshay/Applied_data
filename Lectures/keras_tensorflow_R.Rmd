This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
## install keras and tensorflow
install.packages("keras")
library(keras)
install_keras()
```

```{r}
#The MNIST dataset is included with Keras and can be accessed using the dataset_mnist() function. Here we load the dataset then create variables for our test and training data:


mnist <- dataset_mnist()
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y

#The x data is a 3-d array (images,width,height) of grayscale values. To prepare the data for training we convert the 3-d arrays into matrices by reshaping width and height into a single dimension (28x28 images are flattened into length 784 vectors). Then, we convert the grayscale values from integers ranging between 0 to 255 into floating point values ranging between 0 and 1:

dim(x_train)

## rescale the image to be a vector of pixels
dim(x_train) <- c(nrow(x_train), 784)
dim(x_test) <- c(nrow(x_test), 784)

dim(x_train)

# rescale
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test <- x_test / 255

```

```{r}
#The y data is an integer vector with values ranging from 0 to 9. To prepare this data for training we one-hot encode the vectors into binary class matrices using the Keras to_categorical() function:

# similair to the way we categorized types of coal plants with binaries, in fact, exactly like that

y_train[1:20] # y_test is similiar

y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)


y_train[1:20,1:10]
summary(y_train) #shows how often a digit shows up


```

```{r}
#The core data structure of Keras is a model, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the sequential model, a linear stack of layers.
#We begin by creating a sequential model and then adding layers using the pipe (%>%) operator:

# In the keras NN we have to "manually" build the layers

model <- keras_model_sequential() 
model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(784)) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = "softmax")

# activation = "relu" : https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Activation_Functions
# Here softmax is serving as an “activation” or “link” function, shaping the output of our linear function into the form we want – in this case, a probability distribution over 10 cases. You can think of it as converting tallies of evidence into probabilities of our input being in each class. It’s defined as:

?layer_dense

summary(model)

```

```{r}
# Next, compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics:

model %>% compile(
  loss = "categorical_crossentropy",
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
  metrics = c("accuracy")
)
```

```{r}
#Use the fit() function to train the model for 30 epochs using batches of 128 images:

history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train, 
  epochs = 30, batch_size = 128, 
  validation_split = 0.2
)

plot(history)

model %>% evaluate(x_test, y_test,verbose = 0)

# the loss is usually negative log-likelihood and residual sum of squares for classification and regression respectively
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
