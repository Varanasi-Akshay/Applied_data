This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

## let's make some distributions of fuel prices to use
## all these are modeled as independant, but if they depended on each other, you'd want to make them functions of each other, etc.
## we will assume that gas and coal prices have normal distributions
ng_price <- rnorm(1:10000, mean = 3, sd = 0.75)
ng_price <- ng_price[ng_price > 0.5]
sub_price <- rnorm(1:10000, mean = 1.5, sd = 0.25)
sub_price <- sub_price[sub_price > 0.5]
lig_price <- rnorm(1:10000, mean = 2.35, sd = 0.50)
lig_price <- lig_price[lig_price > 0.5]
nuke_price <- rnorm(1:10000, mean = 1.25, sd = 0.15)
nuke_price <- nuke_price[nuke_price > 0.5]

## see the distributions

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
